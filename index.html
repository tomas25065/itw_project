                <span class="line"></span>
                <p>In parallel with the music,  I develop a plastic work , which I exhibit in the streets of the world, captivating the attention of people who are not typical museum visitors and thus offers a  mix between street-art and graphics , where I plays with references from  pop culture  and our childhood, without losing the dreamy tone that characterizes me in all  my artistic work. 
                    My approach in street-art is to adapt to architecture  or urban elements in order to divert them  in order to make passers-by smile.  
                    Basically a graphic designer,  and after studying at an art school (ESMA) , I learned to master  photo / video  editing software in  order to be able to put my lucid dreams into images* (as weird as they are) and thus, in addition to my street arts, create digital works  tinged with humor and poetry  on the border between  the real and the imaginary world.

                <h1>Music</h1>
                <span class="line"></span>
                <p>Producer/Dj  for 10 years now, my music has been played all over the world and counts  millions of views.

                    The atmosphere I create and the vibe I try to give off are a mix... between  dreamy and groovy,
                    
                    inspired by  Reggae, Soul, Indie.  My goal is to mix so-called “real” instruments  with house/techno.
                    
                    My evolution and my concerts around the planet have given me  an open mind  and a vision of the world which  have allowed me to develop  my musical culture towards  world music.
                    
                    And at the same time to create  my own artistic approach: sampler  (record)  using my microphones and my mobile studio the ambient elements or artists that I meet on my way to put them  in my music in  order to create  works unique with a story.</p>

                <span class="line"></span>
                <p>
                    Passionate about art and seeing the world as  an inexhaustible source of inspiration  , but above all as a real school of life, intense and wonderful. In recent years my concerts in the  4 corners of the planet  have led me to travel a lot and thus live each trip  as a new experience.  Living from day to day, enjoying every moment while facing loneliness, fear of the unknown, and nostalgia…  in short, all these parameters that make us feel  much more ALIVE and  make us know ourselves better.

                    During these  last 6 years,  I have been able to record  hundreds of artists , and thus make exceptional encounters  (tribes / street artists, etc.)  full of humility and love which have led me to want to create the project: “Borders Lost“ revolved around my passions.
